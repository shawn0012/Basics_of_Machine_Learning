# Basics_of_Machine_Learning
*For this task the answer must be submitted as a GitHub repository containing a google colab notebook and all the files required to run the colab notebook*
01. - [x] Create a Google Colab Notebook and upload it to the github repository.
02. - [x] Load a stereo audio file of your choice.
03. - [x] Implement Prof. Schullerâ€™s Convolutional Autoencoder in the Colab Notebook (https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/fileadmin/media/mt/lehre/ba_mt/praxiswst_signalkodierung/machineLearningforAudio6.pdf)
04. - [x] Train the Convolutional Autoencoder model with one channel of the audio file (for example the Left channel).
05. - [x] Plot a graph with the number of epochs in the x axis and the training loss in the y-axis.
06. - [x] Infer (test) the model with the other channel of the audio file (for example if you used the Left channel now you will use the Right channel)
07. - [x] Playback the output of the model in the notebook so we can listen how the reconstructed audio signal sounds.
08. - [x] Calculate the mean squared error between the original test audio signal, and the predicted (the reconstructed) audio signal.
